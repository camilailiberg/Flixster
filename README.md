### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes. I felt that being introduced to CSS Flex was super helpfull. In terms of HTML I felt that the weekly lab wasa good reviewer and introduction and was good enoigh for the minimum requirements of the assignment. Finally, the lab for APIs was SUPER useful because it gave the the basics of how APIs work and I was able to use that when working on my assignmnet. If anything, CSS and JavaScript syntax were the two main things I didn't feel super comfortable with, but I did not feel unprepared for any of the required features.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had had more time I would have tried to make the poster display more nicer. I would have also like to implement a "go back up" feature when scrolling down or loading more movies. Overall I think that if I would had had more time I would had play and experiment more with the CSS and JavaScrit and make the website look and feel nicer for the user.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think that everything went well. I was able to implement all of the require and extra features. I did see a search bar that expanded itself when the user clicked on it in one of my peers website and I definitelly would like to try doing that.
